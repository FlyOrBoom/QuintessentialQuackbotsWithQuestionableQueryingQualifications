# QuintessentialQuackbotsWithQuestionableQueryingQualifications
## Everyone wants a quintessential quackbot with questionable querying qualifications!
This is a repo of all the Discord bots I have. They all use the [Discord.py library](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

Each folder has a bot. To run a bot yourself, add a `.env` file to its folder, with the line `TOKEN=the_bot_token_you_got_from_Discord`. Install all the necessary PIP modules, then `python3 botname.py`.
